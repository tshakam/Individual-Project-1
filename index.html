    <h2><span class="headings"> More about me</span></h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Trevor Muthama. I am 22 years old. I mostly enjoy tarantino movies and a wide array of music. I recently completed a degree program at United States International University Africa pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Systems and Technology concentrating in Information Assurance. I first took
    notice of information assurance while undertaking an internship program at NORDA Industries Kenya, where I held a systems administrator intern position. As a systems administration intern, I was required to perform tasks such as determining user functions for various employees. I have recently enrolled at morniga school
    because i am excited about what computers can do for us in this day and age, i hope to gain invaluable information and also gain knowledge in social interactions as a developer</p>
